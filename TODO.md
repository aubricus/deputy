# TODO

## Develop v0.0.1

Goals:

- Work out command-line aggregation through docopt
- Make adding "tasks" easy; like in fabric but with more suppor for complete cli:
    - options
    - commands
    - command groups
- Keep things minimal; even so much as just passing on commands to an assigned module.

Plugins:

- Stevedore? <http://stevedore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>
- Discover extensions?
- Compile commands?
    - Maybe, compile sub commands from plugins.
    - See: <https://github.com/docopt/docopt/tree/master/examples/git>
    - The only thing we need to generate is the top level help string.
