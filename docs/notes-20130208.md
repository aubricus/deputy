# Deputy Planning Notes

## Thoughts
Deputy actually won't *do* very much. It will in fact be a skeleton framework that discovers / registers plug-ins and provides a flexible way to unify tooling around your process.

* The framework will allow developers to choose their own tools / implementations / solutions to their development problems.

* The CLI itself could be constructed by the plug-ins

* Deputy essentially is a mediator. It will combine and run your plug-ins but its up to the plug-ins to actually do the work.

## Plugin Model
* Discover / Register
* Provide CLI Hooks
* Provide automatic routing from CLI arguments into plug ins
